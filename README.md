# bash-scripts
A repository containing script to automate silly things in my daily life

To give permission of execution use chmod u+x and the script
```bash
chmod u+x 'scriptName'
```

If the problem persist, use sudo
```bash
sudo chmod u+x 'scriptName'
```
To make useful the script in a workaround and not only in the directory of the repo
```bash
echo $PATH to see your environment variables
which node
cp 'output of which node' 'scriptName'
output of which node or similar : /usr/local/bin/'scriptName'
which 'scriptName'
'scriptName'
```
